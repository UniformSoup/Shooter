# Shooter
A 3D shooter in OpenGL that I will never finish.

15/05/2021:
Wont be able to work for a while because of exams. 
But simple collision detection has been added and a range of utilities (although rough) are present.
A big collidable class needs to be created, and 3d models still need to be added in.
